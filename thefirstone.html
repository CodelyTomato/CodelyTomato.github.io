<p> People are strange. Isn't it annoying when people don't act like you expect? Or anything doesn't go according to plan? I think probably around 8th grade
most people find themselves having gone through (most) situations that life has to offer. From then on we can go through the day without having to manually calculate
each decision, we can just rely on past behavior, reflect on its outcome (positive or negative), and see if we can just skip the whole fucking decision making and just
skip to autopilot. Hint: your brain is mostly on autopilot.</p>
<p> If I could go back to my former self and help him do anything, it would be to set better patterns for the rest of my life, because then I could've set better
patterns for myself. For those who did set those good patterns, it must be so easy just to go outside or start studying or make yourself eat a healthy meal. For me,
the pattern doesn't exist; I have to manually convince myself to overwrite past behavior and say 'yeah buddy, your damn right were gonna eat this salad' while my brain
is reflecting on how good culvers fries were back in 5th grade.</p>
<p> Honestly, we're more like computers than anyone would care to realize. It all boils down to binary. Yes or no decisons made in the blink of an eye. Yeah, there's some
biology incorporated, I can't even begin to explain how a consciousness is even possible. But every behavior that recieves an outcome is interpretedcd to be either good
or bad. 1 or 0. This is usually calculated by an outside force: family, friends, teachers, coaches, etc. Like stated before: first decade of your life: data collection.
Which decisions are favorable. What can't and can I do. Then you graduate! Your computer is now capable of 1) really good decisions - ones that have always , or mostly always
recieve positive outcomes. 2) mixed decisions - sometimes good, sometimes bad. A wildcard. 3) bad decision - outcome is never favorable. </p>
<p> This can be good an bad I suppose. On the one hand, I don't have to manually calculate mundane decisions like when to shower or what I like to eat for breakfast. But,
now I lack control over more serious things like the way I act with friends or what I say to people. I was not very smart for the first decade of my life. The patterns I
developed there: not very good ones. Probably why I tend to have the humor of a ten year old :) </p>
<p> A scary conclusion to my first blog, but it's something I've always wanted to talk about on my blog if I ever made one, so I thought it was fitting. Ciao. </p>
